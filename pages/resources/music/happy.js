              <br /> Verse 1
              <br /> It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
              <br /> Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
              <br /> I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
              <br /> With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way
              <br />
              <br /> Chorus
              <br /> (Because I'm happy)
              <br /> Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
              <br /> (Because I'm happy)
              <br /> Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
              <br /> (Because I'm happy)
              <br /> Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
              <br /> (Because I'm happy)
              <br /> Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
              <br />
              <br /> Verse 2
              <br /> Here come bad news, talking this and that (Yeah!)
              <br /> Well, give me all you got, don't hold it back (Yeah!)
              <br /> Well, I should probably warn ya, I'll be just fine (Yeah!)
              <br /> No offense to you, donâ€™t waste your time, here's why
